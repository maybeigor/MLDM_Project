        "In our project, we aimed at finetuning several existing audio models, one of which includes Whisper model by OpenAI.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI. It utilizes a deep learning architecture to convert spoken language into written text. It involves several steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Preparation: Whisper requires a large amount of labeled audio data for training. This data is typically collected and transcribed, creating pairs of audio segments and their corresponding textual transcripts. The data is then preprocessed to extract features that capture relevant information from the audio signals, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or spectrograms.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Acoustic Modeling: Whisper utilizes a deep neural network architecture, often based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to model the relationship between audio features and textual representations. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are commonly used due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. The audio features are fed into the network, which predicts the probability distribution over a set of linguistic units (such as phonemes or subword units) at each time step.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Language Modeling: To improve the accuracy of transcription, Whisper incorporates a language model that adds linguistic context to the ASR system. Language models can be based on n-gram models, recurrent neural networks, or transformers. These models help resolve ambiguities and improve the overall quality of the transcriptions by considering the likelihood of certain word sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Training: The Whisper model is trained using a large amount of paired audio-text data. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the difference between predicted transcriptions and the ground truth transcriptions. This is typically done using gradient-based optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Decoding: Once the Whisper model is trained, it can be used for inference on new, unseen audio data. During decoding, the model takes as input the audio features and generates a sequence of predicted linguistic units. This sequence is then transformed into the final text output using decoding techniques such as the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) algorithm or attention mechanisms."

        "1. Conv1d: This class is a subclass of nn.Conv1d, which represents a 1-dimensional convolutional layer in a neural network. The _conv_forward method is implemented to override the base class's _conv_forward method. It performs the convolution operation by calling the _conv_forward method of the base class and passing the input tensor x, weight tensor weight (converted to the same data type as x), and bias tensor (if not None, converted to the same data type as x).\n",

It takes three arguments: length (the length of the sinusoids), channels (the number of channels in the output tensor), and max_timescale (the maximum timescale value for the sinusoids). It calculates logarithmic timescale increments based on the number of channels and uses them to generate sinusoids for both sine and cosine functions. The resulting sinusoids are concatenated along the channel dimension and returned as a tensor.\n",

The class defines several linear layers (self.query, self.key, self.value, self.out) which are used to project the input to the corresponding dimensions for attention calculations.\n",

It takes x as the input tensor, xa as an optional auxiliary input tensor, mask as an optional mask tensor, and kv_cache as an optional dictionary used for caching key-value projections for cross-attention. It first applies the query projection (self.query) to x. Depending on the presence of kv_cache and xa, it either performs key-value projections using self.key and self.value, or retrieves them from the cache. Then, it calls the qkv_attention method to compute the attention weights and the weighted sum of values. Finally, it applies the output projection (self.out) to the weighted sum and returns the result along with the attention weights.\n",

        "5. qkv_attention method: This method performs the core calculations of the multi-head attention mechanism. It takes query tensor q, key tensor k, and value tensor v. It reshapes and permutes the tensors to prepare them for attention calculations. It calculates the attention scores by multiplying the query and key tensors, applies an optional mask, and performs softmax normalization. Finally, it computes the weighted sum of values using the attention scores and returns the result along with the attention scores.\n",
